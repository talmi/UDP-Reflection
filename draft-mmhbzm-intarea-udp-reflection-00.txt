                User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Reflection
                 draft-mmhbzm-intarea-udp-reflection-00

Abstract

   This document describes the UDP Reflection utility.  It is similar to
   Ping in that it relies on a stateless message exchange between two
   hosts.  The initiating host sends a UDP packet with an unused
   destination port and the destination host sends back an ICMP
   Destination Unreachable.  The payload of the ICMP message includes a
   possibly trimmed copy of the original UDP message.  Specifically, if
   the original message is sent over IPv6, the ICMP message includes the
   IPv6 header and IPv6 extension headers and options if they are
   present.

1.  Introduction

   The UDP Reflection utility is a UDP [RFC768] based diagnostic tool.
   It is similar to the Ping [RFC2151] utility as it uses a message
   exchange between an initiating host and a destination host.

   Each message exchange includes:

   *  A UDP packet that is sent by the initiating host to the
      destination host with a reserved destination port number.  Port
      33434 has been reserved by IANA for Traceroute and is used in UDP
      Reflection as well.

   *  An ICMP Destination Unreachable that is sent back to the
      initiating host due to the unused port in the UDP packet.  The
      ICMP message includes, in its payload, the original UDP packet (or
      a trimmed version of it), including its IP header and payload.

   UDP Reflection operates in a similar manner to the last hop of the
   Traceroute utility [RFC2151].  As opposed to Traceroute, UDP
   Reflection does not iteratively try to reach each of the routers
   along the path to the destination, but directly sends a UDP packet to
   the destination host.

   The UDP Reflection exchange allows the initiating host to verify the
   reachability to the destination and to measure the round-trip time.
   The initiating host can also extract the header of the original
   packet from the received ICMP message, allowing to analyze header
   fields or extension headers that were modified along the path between
   the initiating host and the destination host.

2.  Requirement Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Use Cases

   The following protocols define mutable IPv6 extension headers that
   can be used to trace a path and its performance:

   *  IPv6 Options for In Situ Operations, Administration, and
      Maintenance (IOAM) [RFC9486]

   *  Inband Flow Analyzer [I-D.kumar-ippm-ifa]

   *  Path Tracing in SRv6 networks [I-D.filsfils-ippm-path-tracing]

   *  Segment Routing Header encapsulation for In-situ OAM Data
      [I-D.ali-spring-ioam-srv6]

   These extensions are used to collect information along a packet's
   delivery path.  Currently, the collected information is sent to a
   controller for processing.  However, in some cases this information
   is relevant to the sender.

   The Reflection utility defined in this document provides a mechanism
   by which this information can be returned to the initiating host.

4.  Theory of Operation

   The UDP Reflection utility is invoked by an initiating host that
   sends a sequence of one or more packets.  Each message exchange
   includes the following procedure:

   *  The initiating host sends a UDP packet with a reserved UDP
      destination port.  Port 33434, which has been reserved by IANA for
      Traceroute, is used for this purpose.  The packet can be sent over
      IPv4 or IPv6.  If the packet is IPv6, it can include one or more
      extension fields.

   *  The destination host receives the UDP packet and detects that the
      UDP destination port is unused.  It generates an ICMP Destination
      Unreachable back to the initiating host.  If the original packet
      is IPv4, then the ICMP message includes the first 8 octets of the
      original packet, as defined in [RFC792].  If the original packet
      is IPv6, the ICMP message includes as much of the original message
      as possible without exceeding the MTU, as defined in [RFC4443].

   *  The initiating host receives the ICMP message and can analyze its
      payload.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not include any requirements from IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   From a security perspective this document does not introduce new
   security threats beyond the threats that are already applicable for
   existing ICMP messages, and are described in [RFC792] and [RFC4443].
